# What is a bug fix? #
A bug fix is a change, which corrects for something, but do **not** add new features.

# Fixes in the stable release #
From time to time there are bugs in the stable release. These possible also needed to be added to the development (default) brnach as well

# How to #

  * Checkout the stable branch (if bug exist in the stable release as well): `hg update stable`
  * Fix the bug
    * Possibly a user has exported a changeset, so import it: `hg import file`
    * Possibly a user send a patch, so apply it: `patch -p1 <file.patch`
  * Commit the change: `hg commit -m "bla bla (fixed issue #XXX)`. The string 'fixed issue #XXX` will prompt googlecode to close the issue with number XXX.
  * Merge it into the default branch
    * `hg update default`
    * `hg merge stable`
    * Possibly fix conflicts
      * `edit file`
      * `hg resolve -m file`
    * `hg commit -m "merge with stable"`
    * `hg push`
